# Data Visualization Project Proposal - Nuclear Explosions

This is a proposal for my data visualization project using the Nuclear Explosions dataset.

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Nuclear Explosions dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-08-20). This dataset contains information about nuclear explosions that were deployed from 1945 to 1998. The data contains information such as:
 * the date and year of the explosion, 
 * a unique ID, 
 * which country deployed the device, 
 * where the device was deployed, 
 * the source who reported the deployment, 
 * the latitude and longitude of where the device was deployed, 
 * magnitude and depth of the deployment, 
 * the purpose of the deployment, 
 * the name of the device, and
 * the method of deployment.

## Prototypes

What protypes have I done? What do they show? Include images on what I have done so far. 
To include images: use snipping tool for the visualization, copy it, make a new issue, paste image in textbox, name: new image, copy the markdown text, edit readme file and paste the markdown text.
To click on image, it send you to the vizhhub link: copy link from vizhub, edit readme, make the whole image text in [] and paste the link in the () after it.
